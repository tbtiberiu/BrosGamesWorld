        <h1>Stanciu Andrei</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Andrei Stanciu and I am a student in 10th grade at National College “Nicolae Titulescu” Pucioasa. I am an ambitious person and I like to do everything I can to help people around me.
I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best. In that project, this passion led me to challenge myself daily and learn new skills that helped me to do better work. On the other hand, to maintain my healthy life I practice cycling, now I am an amateur but I hope I can race someday in a Pro Race.
I chose to participate in that project with Tibi because this is our second project together. We made great work on the last project and I am happy I found a person like Tibi.

        <h1>Boscan Tiberiu</h1>
        <p>
          Hey! I am Tiberiu Boșcan. I study at the same college as Andrei. I am in 11th grade. I love programming and memes and also improving my work every day. Web development is a passion of mine for quite some time. With Andrei’s help, I could advance faster than I could alone. We are like IT brothers and this is how the website got its name.
